# Day planner
This repository contains a work day planner. This planner allows you to enter items that need to get done for each hour of the work day. It will change the color of each hour of the work day, based on the current time.

## Outline of the Day Planner
This repository has some unique features, which are outlined below:
1. The current day of the week is displayed at the top of the page.
2. There are timeblocks (per hour) from 9AM -5PM. 
3. Each timeblock will dynamically change color depending on the time of day. If the hour has passed it will be gray, if it is currently that hour it will be red, if the hour is in the future it will be green.
4. Each timeblock has an input box that allows you to enter a task for that period.
5. If you wish to save that task, you can press the save button next to the task.
6. Upon refreshing or revisiting the page at a later time, these tasks will still be there.
